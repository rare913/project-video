    <p> A member of the Uchiha clan, Madara grew up during the Warring States Period, where he
        became a prodigy alongside his brother Izuna. His deep but ultimately tragic friendship with Hashirama Senju,
        later the First Hokage, shaped his worldview. Disillusioned by the endless cycle of war, Madara sought to create
        a world free of suffering through extreme means, ultimately becoming a villain. His ambition and ideology drove
        him to seek control over the world, leading to major conflicts in the series.</p>
